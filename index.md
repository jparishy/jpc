I'm an opinionated & pragmatic guy with strong attention to detail and great colloboration skills. I'm easy to work with, not afraid to share my opinion, and the first to admit I'm wrong. I've also been programming for 12 years and see the world through the lens of an engineer. **I can build anything**.

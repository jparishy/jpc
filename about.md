# The Gist

My name is **Julius** -- I'm a **Software Developer** located in **Philadelphia, PA**.

Day to day, I run a **Software Development Company** working with **Universities**. If you've got a larger project, [we may be a fit](https://www.codecygnus.com).

I also build things on a freelance basis for companies and startups. My background is in **Mobile App Development** and **API Design and Development**. I'm a polyglot and regularly code in **Objective-C, Python, Typescript, and R** with a variety of frameworks and tools -- whatever is the best for the job. Sometimes I work in **Ruby and Swift**, too. **Django, DRF, Rails, Express.js, React, UIKit**... you name it, I've probably built something with it.

And for everything else: **I'm a quick learner**.

# About Me

I love to **shoot pool** and explore forests. I dig coffee and want to **write screenplays** for movies one day.    

In the meantime, I write **great code** for **great companies**.

**Let's work together.**

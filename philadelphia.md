           Like many cities today, Philadelphia has a problem with stolen packages outside of people's homes. There are a lot of people trying to tackle this problem in different ways -- I built NoLibsCrime.com to crowdsource stolen package information in real time in order to run analyses on the geospatial data. The application is built on React.js & MobX on the frontend and Flask & PostGIS on the backend.

          <p>I love Philadelphia and want to see the city improve for everyone. If you have ideas on how to expand on this project or want to collaborate, reach out: hello@juliusparishy.com</p>
